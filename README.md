# Ikiminds_App

App designed for Ikiminds. Team of 4 people who designed the application:
- Nikunj
- Divij
- Pranav
- Aman 


The MOBILE APP is the user interface for the users like Parents, Children etc. It is designed on Flutter SDK and uses Express.js server as a backend. 
The database that has been used for the 
purpose here is MongoDB. 
We have also implemented a Payment Gateway in the application using RazorPay API. Location of the user and the device is found
using the Geolocator API. 

The Admin Page is the page for the admins who will login to the system and change the center credentials or add/drop some parameters like centers, change prices etc. 

This was done as a Project work for our DASS 2023 Course.
